# My First Rails App 
This is a sample project to practice setting up a Ruby on Rails template project. After installing Ruby, Rails, and dependencies such as Yarn, you can initialize a Rails app template by running `rails <your app name>`. Running `rails server` will serve your app on localhost:3000. Running `heroku open` will make your open a new tab and navigate to your new heroku site.
